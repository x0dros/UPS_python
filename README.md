# UPS_python
Early early very early stages of creating a UPS API in python

Python code in UPS_python/Shipping_Pkg_Gnd/ShippingPACKAGE/PACKAGEXMLTools/CodeSamples/ShipConfirm/PERL

File name: somethingsilly.py

In the codes (Python and Perl) I have used absolute paths. Need to change these when running on other machines.
